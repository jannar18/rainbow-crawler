## What We're Deciding

How to source the PNG sprite assets needed for Rainbow Crawler's Phase 4 visual polish. The art direction brainstorm defines a "cozy retro" 32x32 pixel art style with a fairy protagonist, corrupted/healed enemies, and crystal cavern environments — but we need actual image files to make it real.

---

## Why This Approach: Itch.io Asset Packs

**Decision:** Source art primarily from itch.io sprite packs, adapting the game's theme to fit the assets rather than commissioning custom art.

**Reasoning:**
- No pixel art experience on the team — creating from scratch would be slow and rough
- Small budget ($5-20) rules out commissioned work but is perfect for itch.io packs
- Game design is flexible — we'll adapt characters/theme to match whatever pack looks best
- Itch.io has the largest selection of indie pixel art, much of it free or very cheap
- Professional-looking results with minimal effort

## Shopping Guide: What to Look For

### Must-Have Assets

| Asset Type | What to Search For | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Dungeon tileset** | Walls, floors, doors at 32x32 (or 16x16 that scales well) | Top-down perspective. Need at least 2-3 wall variants and a floor tile |
| **Player character** | Small fantasy character with 4-directional sprites | Fairy, wizard, sprite — whatever feels right. Needs at least idle + walk frames |
| **2-3 enemy types** | Creatures/monsters with idle animations | One melee, one ranged if possible. Dark/spooky aesthetic preferred |
| **Projectile/effect** | Small particle or magic effect sprites | For the rainbow beam — could also be built procedurally from colored squares |

### Nice-to-Have Assets

- Door/portal animation
- HUD frame or border elements
- Item pickups (hearts, gems, etc.)
- Death/defeat animation for enemies

### 16x16 vs 32x32 Note

Many of the best dungeon packs are 16x16. These can work at 32x32 by:
- Rendering them at 2x scale (each pixel becomes a 2x2 block) — gives a chunkier retro look
- Using them as-is and adjusting the grid to 16x16 (more cells, smaller sprites)
- The 2x scaling approach actually fits the "cozy retro" aesthetic well

## CHOSEN PACKS

### Primary: 0x72's DungeonTileset II — FREE, CC-0

**Link:** https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii

Base tileset with dungeon walls/floors/doors, heroes (knight, wizard, archer), 10+ enemy types (goblins, demons, undead, orcs, zombies, lizards, dwarfs, slugs), props (torches, traps, chests, barrels), weapons. 16x16, render at 2x scale. CC-0 — no restrictions.

### Expansion: SuperDark's Enchanted Forest Characters — FREE, CC-0

**Link:** https://superdark.itch.io/enchanted-forest-characters

Designed as a direct companion to 0x72's DungeonTileset II — same resolution, animation structure, and color palette. 20+ forest-themed characters:

- **Fairy** — perfect player character, aligns with art direction brainstorm
- **Forest creatures:** Mushroom Folk (small/medium/large), dire wolf, bear, ent/treeman, golem
- **Humanoids:** Wood elves (male/female), high elven princess, elvenking, elite high elf knight, forest ranger, hermit wizard, forest bandit, travelling clerics (3 sizes)
- **Enemies:** Troll brute, centaurs (male/female), gnoll overseer/shaman/brute/grunt

All sprites have idle + walk animations. PNG spritesheet + individual frames. CC-0 — no restrictions.

### Why This Combo Works

- Both packs are CC-0 — total freedom, no license worries
- Designed to be used together — identical style, size, and animation format
- The fairy sprite from the expansion gives us the protagonist from the art direction brainstorm
- Mushroom Folk, gnolls, and trolls make great "corrupted creatures to heal" enemies
- 0x72 provides the dungeon environment; SuperDark provides the forest/enchanted characters
- Combined cost: $0

## Key Decisions

- **Chosen packs:** 0x72's DungeonTileset II + SuperDark's Enchanted Forest Characters
- **License:** Both CC-0 (public domain) — no attribution required, any use permitted
- **Scale strategy:** 16x16 sprites rendered at 2x to fill 32x32 cells — chunky retro look
- **Player character:** Fairy sprite from Enchanted Forest pack
- **Enemies:** Mix of dungeon creatures (0x72) and forest creatures (SuperDark)
- **Art direction:** Keep existing brainstorm as inspiration; actual visuals driven by these packs

## Resolved Questions

1. **Do we want animations or static sprites first?** Both packs include idle + walk animations. We'll figure out the animation system at integration time.
2. **Should we update the art direction brainstorm after picking a pack?** No — keep it as inspiration, not a spec. The packs drive the actual visuals.
3. **Which packs to use?** 0x72 DungeonTileset II + SuperDark Enchanted Forest Characters. Both free, both CC-0, designed to work together.

## Integration Plan (High Level)

When we have the PNGs, the integration path is:
1. Drop PNGs into a `public/sprites/` directory
2. Load them as PixiJS textures at game init
3. Replace `drawRect()` calls with `drawSprite()` calls in the render method
4. The renderer already has `drawSprite(gridX, gridY, texture)` — so the API is ready

This is a Phase 4 task. No code changes needed until then.
